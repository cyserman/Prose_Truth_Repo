=== THREAD ANCHOR ===
Date: 2025-12-17
Owner: Christopher Firey

PURPOSE
Freeze context and prevent hallucination

GROUND TRUTH
• Vehicle failure (2004 Ford F-250) during custody exchange
• Communication interference ongoing (blocked app)
• Housing-insecure but employed

CORE LEGAL THEORY
Manufactured imbalance, not parental fitness
Pattern: Removal → Denial of tools → PFA filings → Delay → Status quo hardening

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
1. Neutralize status quo
2. Restore court oversight
3. Re-establish parent-child contact
4. Remove financial leverage

TIMELINE-FIRST STRATEGY
If it can be dated, it goes on the timeline.
If it can be documented, it gets an exhibit code.
Goal: Judge understands in under 10 minutes.

=== WHAT A WIN LOOKS LIKE ===

Winning is correction and trajectory, not domination.

- Status quo loses immunity
- Court oversight restored
- Ramped custody begins
- Financial leverage collapses
- Case becomes boring

NOT A WIN:
- Public scolding
- Moral vindication
- Instant 50/50
