# 00_ANCHORS

## PURPOSE

Constitutional documents that define case strategy, objectives, and AI behavior.

**Read these first** before working with any other part of the repository.

## FILES

- **AGENT_PERSONA.json** - AI assistant configuration and capabilities
- **ANCHOR_WHAT_WIN_LOOKS_LIKE.md** - Definition of success in judicial terms
- **DACHSHUND_UI_AUDIT.txt** - React UI feature audit and status
- **THREAD_ANCHOR_2025-12-17.txt** - Core legal theory and strategic objectives
- **UPLOAD_TO_AI_KNOWLEDGE.txt** - Consolidated context for AI knowledge bases

## IMMUTABILITY

These documents are **anchors** - they should change rarely and deliberately.

Changes to these files represent fundamental shifts in:
- Case strategy
- Legal theory
- Success criteria
- AI behavior

## USAGE

### For Humans
Read to understand the case's strategic foundation before drafting motions or analyzing timelines.

### For AI Agents
Load these files first to:
- Calibrate output tone (neutral, court-ready)
- Understand core legal theory (manufactured imbalance)
- Know what "winning" means (trajectory, not domination)
- Avoid hallucination by staying within documented facts
