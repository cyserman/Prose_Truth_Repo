Date: 2025-12-17
Owner: Christopher Firey

PURPOSE
-------
This document freezes the factual, strategic, and architectural conclusions reached
across a long, mixed-context thread. It prevents loss of context.

SECTION 1 — IMMEDIATE REALITY (GROUND TRUTH)
• Primary vehicle (2004 Ford F-250) failure during custody exchange.
• Driving unsafe vehicle was avoided.
• Missed exchanges were safety-based, not willful.
• Communication interference is ongoing (blocked app).
• Father is housing-insecure but employed.

SECTION 2 — CORE LEGAL THEORY
This case centers on a **manufactured imbalance**, not parental fitness.
The pattern: Removal -> Denial of tools -> PFA filings -> Delay -> Status Quo hardening.
Requested relief is CORRECTIVE, not PUNITIVE.

SECTION 3 — STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
1. Neutralize presumption of status quo.
2. Restore court oversight.
3. Re-establish parent-child contact.
4. Remove financial leverage.

SECTION 4 — TIMELINE-FIRST STRATEGY
If it can be dated, it goes on the timeline.
If it can be documented, it gets an exhibit code.
Goal: Judge understands case in <10 mins.

SECTION 5 — SOFTWARE
Local-first Pro Se Legal DB: Import -> Index -> Print.
