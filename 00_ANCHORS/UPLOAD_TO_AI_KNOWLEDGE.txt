THREAD ANCHOR
F250 -> Legal -> Pro Se App
Date: 2025-12-17
Owner: Christopher Firey

PURPOSE
-------
This document freezes the factual, strategic, and architectural conclusions reached
across a long, mixed-context thread. It prevents loss of context.

SECTION 1 — IMMEDIATE REALITY (GROUND TRUTH)
• Primary vehicle (2004 Ford F-250) failure during custody exchange.
• Driving unsafe vehicle was avoided.
• Missed exchanges were safety-based, not willful.
• Communication interference is ongoing (blocked app).
• Father is housing-insecure but employed.

SECTION 2 — CORE LEGAL THEORY
This case centers on a **manufactured imbalance**, not parental fitness.
The pattern: Removal -> Denial of tools -> PFA filings -> Delay -> Status Quo hardening.
Requested relief is CORRECTIVE, not PUNITIVE.

SECTION 3 — STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
1. Neutralize presumption of status quo.
2. Restore court oversight.
3. Re-establish parent-child contact.
4. Remove financial leverage.

SECTION 4 — TIMELINE-FIRST STRATEGY
If it can be dated, it goes on the timeline.
If it can be documented, it gets an exhibit code.
Goal: Judge understands case in <10 mins.

SECTION 5 — SOFTWARE
Local-first Pro Se Legal DB: Import -> Index -> Print.


=== WHAT A WIN LOOKS LIKE ===
# ANCHOR: WHAT A WIN LOOKS LIKE
**Date:** 2025-12-17

## PURPOSE
To define "winning" in realistic, judicial terms and prevent emotional burnout.

## THE WIN
Winning is **correction and trajectory**, not domination.

**LAYER 1:** Status quo loses immunity. The court questions how the arrangement arose.
**LAYER 2:** Court inserts structure (GAL, schedules).
**LAYER 3:** Ramped custody begins.
**LAYER 4:** Financial leverage collapses (Bifurcation).
**LAYER 5:** The case becomes boring.

## WHAT WINNING IS NOT
- Public scolding of the other party.
- Moral vindication.
- Instant 50/50 after disruption.

=== DACHSHUND UI AUDIT ===
UI AUDIT — PROSE LEGAL DB (REACT VERSION)
───────────────────────────────────────────────
✅ OVERVIEW
You’ve implemented a full React-based interface that integrates:
- Timeline builder with neutralization logic
- CSV import/export for case data
- Strategic Analyzer using Gemini (future backend slot)
- Print-to-PDF for judge-ready format
- Evidence and Exhibit index linkage

───────────────────────────────────────────────
⚙️ FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS
• Timeline View
  - Event table with classification badges
  - Real-time search & category filtering
  - ✨ Neutralization button (rewrites emotional text → court-ready language)
  - Exhibit link display for each row

• Strategic Analyzer
  - Uses `runStrategicAnalysis()` to build tactical insight
  - Outputs “Clean Moves” and Evidence Gaps
  - Perfect bridge to automated Summary Generator (Phase 2 of your plan)

• Import / Export
  - CSV import for NORMALIZED_TIMELINE.csv and EXHIBIT_INDEX.csv
  - JSON backup generator for the “truth repo” archive
  - Fully local-first; no data leaves the browser

• Print Mode
  - Clean, serif PDF-ready layout
  - Uses minimal branding; outputs “Exhibit A – Motion for Restored Parenting Time”
  - Auto page-break control and compact design

───────────────────────────────────────────────
🧩 STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT
This UI now directly fulfills your:
1. **Summary Generator Plan** — manual input + clean neutral output
2. **Pro Se Agent Architecture** — Gemini-based auto-analysis (Phase 2)
3. **Evidence Indexer Goal** — CSV-driven exhibit linkage

───────────────────────────────────────────────
🧠 NEXT IMPROVEMENTS
1. 🔐 Add `localStorage` persistence
   → Keeps timeline & exhibit state after browser refresh.

2. 🗂️ Integrate auto-summary builder
   → Map `runStrategicAnalysis()` output to a “Generate Custody Summary” function.

3. 📄 Add export-to-PDF button in print mode
   → Wrap with `window.print()` or `html2pdf.js` for direct save.

4. ⚖️ Link neutralization edits back to CSV
   → Optional `Download Cleaned_Timeline.csv` export.

───────────────────────────────────────────────
STATUS:
Stable — UI phase complete.  
Ready to integrate with Summary Generator Plan (Phase 2 automation).
