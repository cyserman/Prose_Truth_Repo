# ANCHOR: WHAT A WIN LOOKS LIKE
**Date:** 2025-12-17

## PURPOSE
To define "winning" in realistic, judicial terms and prevent emotional burnout.

## THE WIN
Winning is **correction and trajectory**, not domination.

**LAYER 1:** Status quo loses immunity. The court questions how the arrangement arose.
**LAYER 2:** Court inserts structure (GAL, schedules).
**LAYER 3:** Ramped custody begins.
**LAYER 4:** Financial leverage collapses (Bifurcation).
**LAYER 5:** The case becomes boring.

## WHAT WINNING IS NOT
- Public scolding of the other party.
- Moral vindication.
- Instant 50/50 after disruption.
