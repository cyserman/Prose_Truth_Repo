## 🗑️ MOVED TO TRASH

### Entire Folders:
- `Prose_Truth_Repo (1)/` - Contains:
  - Old Python tools (ProSe-File-Organizer, ProSeAgent_backup, Proseagent2)
  - Virtual environments (prose_env, venv)
  - node_modules folders
  - GRIFLAW project (unrelated)
  - Screenshots
  - Zip files
  - 64 judge_timeline PDFs (test runs - all unique but from old system)

- `Prose_Truth_Repo/` - Empty folder

## 📋 NOTES

- The nested `Prose_Truth_Repo/00_ANCHORS/UPLOAD_TO_AI_KNOWLEDGE.txt` had 170 lines vs 148 in current version. It's in trash if you need to compare.

- All case-specific data (CSVs, evidence checklists, case notes) has been preserved.

- Old Python tooling has been moved to trash as it's been replaced by the React app.

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

1. Review `CASE SUMMARY CURRENT LEGAL THEMES ACTION ITEMS.txt` for current relevance
2. Compare timeline CSVs with current timeline data in `02_TIMELINES/`
3. Review court documents to see if they're still relevant
4. Archive or integrate case notes into `00_ANCHORS/` or `08_TASKS_AND_LOGS/` as needed
