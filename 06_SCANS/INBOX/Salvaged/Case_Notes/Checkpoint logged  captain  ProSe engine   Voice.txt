✅ Checkpoint logged, captain. ProSe engine + Voice Code Coach are officially online.

Here’s what you’ve got running right now:


---

🧩 Current State (Solid Baseline)

Core engine

start_prose.py watcher:

Watches ~/Projects/_INBOX

Copies files into ~/Projects/ProSe/inputs/

For PDFs, runs:

batch_enhanced.py --input inputs --out out

judge_timeline_pdf.py --out out --timeline out/timeline.csv --pdf out/judge_timeline.pdf
(only if out/timeline.csv exists)


Auto-commits & pushes via git_sync.



Stability / Safety

Bad/empty PDFs:

Logged clearly

Skipped

No batch crash


judge_timeline_pdf.py only runs if out/timeline.csv exists.

ocr_processor.py now uses prose_core.pdf_utils:

open_pdf_safe

sha256_file


The pipeline is robust enough for “real use,” not just tinkering.


Shared “brain stem”

prose_core/:

pdf_utils.py (open PDF safely, hash files)

sidecar.py (read/write JSON with schema_version)

timeline.py (consistent timeline.csv writer)


This is the hook point for bringing in ProSe3.5 / original PSFO behavior later without spaghetti.


Voice Code Coach

voice_code_coach.py running at http://localhost:5002

Confirmed working via:

curl -s \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"path":"start_prose.py","start_line":1,"end_line":120}' \
  http://localhost:5002/api/v1/explain

It can now:

Explain code in this repo

Propose refactors via diff

Generate basic tests

Search symbols (if rg available)



This is a legit integrated system now: file pipeline + git + code-aware helper.

🎛 Menu of “Next Toys” (pick one later)

When you’re ready to un-pause, here are clean next moves:

1. Add safe apply_patch endpoint

Endpoint: /api/v1/apply_patch

Does:

create branch voice/refactor/<timestamp>

apply unified diff

commit

log before/after HEAD SHA + file list


Only runs when confirm: true is passed.

This turns your coach from “advisor” → “surgical robot with safety harness.”



2. Deeper ProSe3.5 / PSFO integration

Use prose_core as the adapter layer.

Bring over:

better sidecar schema

smarter timeline extraction rules

any specialized doc-handling you liked in 3.5.


The goal: old power, new stability.



3. UX & cleanup

Auto-move processed inputs to inputs/processed/ or _INBOX/processed/ (some of this is already started).

Nicer folder structure:

scripts/, docs/, engine/


Tiny CLI helpers:

./run_timeline_once.py

./dump_status.py (show inbox, inputs, out summary)




4. Make the agent “ProSe-aware”

Feed it:

README_quickstart.md

INTEGRATION_STRATEGY.md

BOT_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.txt


So it talks in terms of _INBOX → inputs → out, timelines, sidecars, etc.

If you want to stop here, you’re at a clean checkpoint:

Repo is sane

Chromebook isn’t screaming

Pipeline works

Voice API works


Next time you say “go,” tell me which thing you want to power up:

> apply_patch, ProSe3.5 integration, cleanup, or agent brain upgrade



and I’ll treat that as the next mission. 🚀
