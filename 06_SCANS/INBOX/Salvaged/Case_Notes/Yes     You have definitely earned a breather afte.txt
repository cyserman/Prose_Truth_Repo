Yes. 😂 You have definitely earned a breather after this lap.

Before you chill, here’s a tiny smoke test plan you can do in 10–15 minutes so your brain knows the system is “real” and not just theory.


---

1. Smoke test the custody CSV

Goal: Confirm Custody_Mod_Evidence.csv behaves like a control panel, not a pile of text.

1. Open Custody_Mod_Evidence.csv in Excel/Sheets/DeX editor.


2. Turn on filters.


3. Change one row:

Pick CUST-004 and set Status from Organized → Used_in_Filing (or To_Collect → Collected if that’s more honest).



4. Save it.



✅ If that works cleanly and still looks tabular, the sheet is good.


---

2. Smoke test sticky_index.json wiring

Goal: Make sure JSON is valid and has at least one sticky tied to evidence.

Add one sticky like this somewhere in sticky_index.json:

{
  "id": "sticky-2024-03-10-sunday-call",
  "title": "Wife blocked Sunday call",
  "category": "custody",
  "date": "2024-03-10",
  "tags": ["calls", "blocked", "alienation"],
  "evidence_ids": ["CUST-002", "CUST-004"],
  "notes": "Use when arguing pattern of contact interference."
}

Then, on any machine with Python:

python - << 'PY'
import json, pathlib

path = pathlib.Path("my_real_case/sticky_index.json")  # adjust if needed
data = json.loads(path.read_text())
print(f"Loaded {len(data)} stickies. First sticky evidence_ids:", data[0].get("evidence_ids"))
PY

✅ If it prints without blowing up, your JSON structure is valid and evidence_ids is wired.


---

3. Smoke test timeline.csv wiring

Goal: Confirm Evidence_IDs column parses and links to real IDs.

Add a row like:

2024-03-10,"Sunday call blocked","Custody","CUST-002;CUST-004","Match to screenshots + contact log"

Then run this little Python check:

python - << 'PY'
import csv, pathlib

path = pathlib.Path("my_real_case/timeline.csv")  # adjust if needed
with path.open(newline='', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    reader = csv.DictReader(f)
    for row in reader:
        if row.get("Evidence_IDs"):
            ids = [x.strip() for x in row["Evidence_IDs"].split(";") if x.strip()]
            print(row["Date"], row["Event"], "->", ids)
PY

✅ If it prints the IDs as a list, your Evidence_IDs field is working.


---

4. Optional: one tiny “lint” script to sanity-check everything

If you’ve got a bit more gas in the tank before the breather, this gives you instant confidence that nothing is out of sync.

Create lint_evidence_links.py:

import csv
import json
from pathlib import Path

BASE = Path("my_real_case")  # adjust base if needed

custody_csv = BASE / "Custody_Mod_Evidence.csv"
sticky_json = BASE / "sticky_index.json"
timeline_csv = BASE / "timeline.csv"

def load_evidence_ids():
    ids = set()
    with custody_csv.open(newline='', encoding="utf-8") as f:
        reader = csv.DictReader(f)
        for row in reader:
            eid = row.get("Evidence_ID")
            if eid:
                ids.add(eid.strip())
    return ids

def load_sticky_ids():
    ids = set()
    if not sticky_json.exists():
        return ids
    data = json.loads(sticky_json.read_text(encoding="utf-8"))
    for sticky in data:
        for eid in sticky.get("evidence_ids", []):
            ids.add(eid.strip())
    return ids

def load_timeline_ids():
    ids = set()
    if not timeline_csv.exists():
        return ids
    with timeline_csv.open(newline='', encoding="utf-8") as f:
        reader = csv.DictReader(f)
        for row in reader:
            field = row.get("Evidence_IDs") or ""
            for eid in [x.strip() for x in field.split(";") if x.strip()]:
                ids.add(eid)
    return ids

def main():
    evidence_ids = load_evidence_ids()
    sticky_ids = load_sticky_ids()
    timeline_ids = load_timeline_ids()

    print(f"Evidence IDs in CSV: {len(evidence_ids)}")
    print(f"Referenced in stickies: {len(sticky_ids)}")
    print(f"Referenced in timeline: {len(timeline_ids)}")

    unknown_in_stickies = sticky_ids - evidence_ids
    unknown_in_timeline = timeline_ids - evidence_ids

    if unknown_in_stickies:
        print("\n⚠ Unknown Evidence_IDs in stickies (not in CSV):")
        for eid in sorted(unknown_in_stickies):
            print("  -", eid)

    if unknown_in_timeline:
        print("\n⚠ Unknown Evidence_IDs in timeline (not in CSV):")
        for eid in sorted(unknown_in_timeline):
            print("  -", eid)

    unused_evidence = evidence_ids - sticky_ids - timeline_ids
    if unused_evidence:
        print("\nℹ Evidence_IDs in CSV not referenced yet (fine, but FYI):")
        for eid in sorted(unused_evidence):
            print("  -", eid)

    if not (unknown_in_stickies or unknown_in_timeline):
        print("\n✅ Links look consistent. Nice work.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Run it:

python lint_evidence_links.py

If you get the ✅ message and maybe a few “not referenced yet,” that’s perfect for this stage.

After that: yes, breather.

You’ve:

Defined a custody evidence control panel

Wired it to stickies and timeline

Given Future You and any future lawyer a map instead of a junk drawer


When you’re ready for the next round, we can either:

Start plugging this into your ProSe tools, or

Use this structure to prep exhibits for the next custody filing.
