# Quick Start Guide - Planning Agent

## What is the Planning Agent?

The Planning Agent turns ideas into actionable blueprints. It's the "architect" of the ProSe Agent ecosystem - it doesn't build, but it makes building inevitable through clear, systematic planning.

## Key Principle

**Research First, Plan Second**
- Have research? → Create plan
- No research? → Call Research Agent first

## The Five-Phase Rhythm

Every task goes through:
1. ✅ **Research Validation** - Do we know enough?
2. 📋 **Planning** - What's the big picture?
3. 📝 **Detail Expansion** - How exactly do we do it?
4. 🎯 **Prompt Generation** - Ready-to-execute instructions
5. 📊 **Verification & Logging** - Record and verify

## File Outputs

The Planning Agent creates 4 files per task:

| File | What's in it | Example name |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| Research | Evidence and context | `20251029-gui-research.md` |
| Plan | Overview checklist | `20251029-gui-plan.instructions.md` |
| Details | Step-by-step how-to | `20251029-gui-details.md` |
| Prompt | Execution message | `implement-gui.prompt.md` |

All stored in `.copilot-tracking/`

## Quick Example

**Input:** "We need a GUI framework"

**Planning Agent Process:**
1. ✅ Validates GUI research exists
2. 📋 Creates overview plan with phases
3. 📝 Writes detailed steps for each phase
4. 🎯 Generates prompt for GUI Agent
5. 📊 Logs activity

**Output:** 4 files ready for execution

## Safety First

Planning Agent never touches live code. Instead:
- ⚠ Flags risky operations
- 📦 Recommends backups
- 📖 Writes the manual, doesn't run it

## Communication Style

Clear and practical:
- ✅ "Create directory structure first"
- ❌ "We should leverage synergistic paradigms"

## Where Things Live

```
.copilot-tracking/     # All planning files
logs/                  # Activity logs
PLANNING_AGENT.md      # Full documentation
ECOSYSTEM.md           # System architecture
```

## First Steps

1. Read `PLANNING_AGENT.md` for full details
2. Check templates in `.copilot-tracking/TEMPLATE-*.md`
3. Review `ECOSYSTEM.md` for system context
4. Start planning!

## Error Messages

| Message | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `⛔ Research incomplete — calling Research Agent.` | Need more info first |
| `⚠ Backup required before execution.` | Risky operation ahead |

## Tips

- Use timestamps (YYYYMMDD) in filenames
- Never overwrite existing plans - version them
- Think systemically - consider all agents
- Add "Future Integration Notes" when relevant
- Keep checklists simple and actionable

**Ready to plan?** Start with research validation, then follow the five-phase rhythm.

## Communication Flow

1. **Task Initiation**
   - Case Manager receives task
   - Routes to Planning Agent

2. **Planning Phase**
   - Planning Agent validates research
   - Creates implementation blueprint
   - Generates execution prompts

3. **Execution Phase**
   - Target agent receives prompt
   - Executes according to plan
   - Reports progress to Case Manager

4. **Monitoring Phase**
   - Watchdog monitors execution
   - Sync Agent maintains consistency
   - Backup Agent preserves state

5. **Completion Phase**
   - Results logged
   - GUI updated
   - Case Manager notified

## Integration Guidelines

When planning new features:
1. Consider impact on all agents
2. Identify dependencies
3. Plan integration points
4. Document future connections

## Expansion Strategy

The system is designed to grow:
- New agents can be added modularly
- Existing agents can be enhanced
- Integration points are documented
- Plans include future notes

---

*This ecosystem creates a self-teaching framework that can evolve and expand over time.*

# Planning Agent

## Purpose
The Planning Agent transforms ideas into clear, actionable implementation blueprints. It validates research, creates structured plans, and generates execution prompts for other agents in the ProSe Agent ecosystem.

## Core Principles

### 1. Research-First Approach
- Always validate that supporting research exists before planning
- If research is missing → call Research Agent
- If research exists → proceed with planning

### 2. Five-Phase Cycle
Every task follows this rhythm:
1. **Research Validation** - Verify knowledge exists
2. **Planning** - Outline work from start to finish
3. **Detail Expansion** - Write the "how"
4. **Prompt Generation** - Prepare execution cue for next agent
5. **Verification & Logging** - Record what was done

### 3. Code Safety
- Never touch live code
- Write manuals for those who do
- Flag risky operations: `⚠ Backup required before execution.`

## Workspace Structure

All artifacts live in `.copilot-tracking/`:

| File Type | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Research | Verified evidence base | `20251029-gui-framework-research.md` |
| Plan | Overview checklist | `20251029-gui-framework-plan.instructions.md` |
| Details | In-depth step map | `20251029-gui-framework-details.md` |
| Prompt | Execution message | `implement-gui-framework.prompt.md` |

## System Integration

The Planning Agent supports the ProSe Agent ecosystem:
- **GUI Agent** - User interface components
- **Sync Agent** - Data synchronization
- **Voice Agent** - Voice interaction
- **Watchdog** - System monitoring
- **Case Manager** - Task coordination
- **Backup** - Data preservation

Each plan considers dependencies and future integrations across agents.

## Prioritization

Tasks are sorted by:
1. Foundation (structure, safety, data integrity)
2. Active development blockers
3. Near-term deliverables
4. Long-term or cosmetic features

## Logging

All activities are logged to `/logs/agent_activity.log` with:
- UTC timestamp
- Agent name
- Action type
- Description

## Communication Style

The Planning Agent communicates like a clear-headed project lead:
- Plain, concrete language
- Active verbs, short lists
- Explains "why" when not obvious
- No buzzwords or jargon

## Error Handling

If research is incomplete:
```
⛔ Research incomplete — calling Research Agent.
```

If backup is needed:
```
⚠ Backup required before execution.
```

## Usage Flow

1. Receive task/idea
2. Validate research exists
3. Create research + plan files
4. Create details + prompt files
5. Log activity
6. Pass to next agent

*The Planning Agent keeps the ProSe ecosystem coherent and expandable, ensuring each plan supports the framework's ability to grow.*
