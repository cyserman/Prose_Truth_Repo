CASE SUMMARY – CURRENT LEGAL THEMES & ACTION ITEMS (NON-ATTORNEY, NON-LEGAL ADVICE)

I. CORE FACT PATTERN (HIGH-LEVEL)

1. Marital Residence / Property
   - Long-term marital home with approximately ~$250k in equity (per your description).
   - You paid the mortgage and other housing-related costs for years while Wife was not employed.
   - Shortly before/around the time you were removed from the home, Wife made one mortgage payment and then excluded you from the residence.
   - Current fear: Wife attempting to establish a "new status quo" in both custody and property, claiming near-100% control.

2. Procedural History – Divorce / Praecipe / Waiver Concern
   - At some stage, you signed a document (likely a praecipe, waiver, or non-contest form) that you now fear:
     - may waive or limit your ability to contest aspects of the divorce or economic claims, and/or
     - may withdraw certain objections.
   - You did not fully understand the consequences at the time and now wish to know if it can be set aside.
   - Realistic view: setting aside such documents is possible only in limited circumstances (fraud, duress, serious misunderstanding, etc.) and is usually an uphill, technical battle that is best handled with counsel.
   - Strategic takeaway: treat “undoing” that paper as a long-term, lawyer-driven task, not the first priority for your pro se energy.

3. Custody / Access / Alienation
   - Current situation:
     - Severely limited contact with your children.
     - Alleged gatekeeping and alienation (calls restricted, “none of your business” on schooling/activities, etc.).
     - Concern that Wife is pushing a narrative of a new “status quo” with you mostly or entirely out of the picture.
   - You have evidence of:
     - Missed or blocked contact,
     - Dismissive responses about your right to know their schooling/activities,
     - Patterns that suggest intentional erosion of your role.

4. Ricky (Partner with Criminal History) & Pregnancy
   - Wife is in a relationship with “Ricky,” who reportedly has violent or serious criminal convictions.
   - There is strong circumstantial evidence:
     - She may be ~7 months pregnant with his child at the time of an upcoming court event.
     - Kids are talking about a “new baby sister.”
     - Visible pregnancy and congratulatory cards in the home.
   - She is denying or minimizing the relationship to you, but reportedly talking about it to others.
   - Safety and stability concerns:
     - Presence of a convicted violent offender in the home,
     - Permanent addition to the household (new baby),
     - Impact on the children’s environment and caregiving.

5. Video Surveillance System (5TB DVR)
   - You installed a multi-camera surveillance system at Wife’s request shortly before you were removed.
   - System:
     - Multiple cameras covering entrances/common areas.
     - Approximately 5TB DVR in the basement, always running.
     - Wife has exclusive control/possession since your removal.
   - Legal relevance:
     - Could show who actually lives there (cohabitation with Ricky),
     - Could document comings/goings related to safety issues.
   - Even if footage is never produced, the existence of a large-capacity DVR under her control supports:
     - a duty to preserve evidence,
     - credibility issues if footage is “unavailable” or “lost.”

6. Financial Misconduct / Gambling (FanDuel / Venmo)
   - Venmo account was drained in connection with a FanDuel-type gambling account.
   - Wife denied knowledge of the service, but:
     - USPS informed delivery shows a physical mailer addressed to her (or your household) linking her to that gambling account.
   - Evidence category:
     - Financial dissipation / misuse of funds.
     - Credibility (denying knowledge while circumstantial evidence suggests involvement).

7. PI (Private Investigator) – Cohabitation Evidence
   - You are considering hiring a local PI to:
     - Document Ricky’s car regularly at Wife’s residence,
     - Capture him leaving the house for work in the morning and returning after work on multiple days.
   - Goal:
     - Show a pattern consistent with cohabitation (overnight presence + repeated comings/goings).
   - This is “nice-to-have, not must-have”:
     - Your case is already supported by documents, logs, pregnancy, DVR, kids’ statements, and criminal history.
     - PI should be used surgically with a capped budget and clear instructions.

II. LIKELY MOTIONS / RELIEF YOU ARE POSITIONING FOR (PENNSYLVANIA FAMILY COURT CONTEXT)

NOTE: Exact titles/forms depend on local rules; this is conceptual.

1. Custody Modification Motion
   - Purpose:
     - Change the current custody order based on:
       - Denied or severely limited access,
       - Alienation/gatekeeping,
       - Safety concerns relating to Ricky and the new household structure,
       - Significant change in circumstances (new partner, new baby, etc.).
   - Key requested relief (examples):
     - A more balanced or defined physical/legal custody schedule.
     - Regular, protected phone/video contact with the children.
     - Conditions to protect the children from exposure to unsafe situations (e.g., restrictions on Ricky’s unsupervised time with the kids).

2. Safety / Risk Evaluation Related to Ricky
   - Purpose:
     - Ask the court to evaluate risk factors associated with a convicted violent offender who is functionally in the children’s household.
   - Possible requests:
     - A custody evaluation or risk assessment that includes review of Ricky’s criminal history.
     - Limitations or conditions on Ricky’s contact:
       - No unsupervised contact,
       - No overnights,
       - Or contact only under specified terms until risk is evaluated.
     - Orders requiring disclosure of:
       - Who resides in the home,
       - Any criminal background related to household members.

3. APL – Alimony Pendente Lite (or Similar Support)
   - Purpose:
     - Temporary financial support while the divorce is pending, so you can maintain stability and litigate.
   - Basis:
     - You were the primary/consistent payer of housing and family expenses during the marriage.
     - You are now out of the house and financially strained.
     - Wife has access to the house, possible additional support from Ricky, and potentially other financial resources.

4. Bifurcation of Issues
   - Purpose:
     - Separate the divorce into distinct tracks:
       - Divorce status,
       - Economic issues (property, support),
       - Custody.
   - Goal:
     - Prevent your financial issues from being frozen indefinitely while custody drama and delays continue.
     - Allow the court to address critical financial disparities and support in parallel with custody.

5. Discovery / Preservation Requests
   - Even if not a separate motion initially, your filings and later discovery can:
     - Request preservation and production of:
       - DVR footage from the 5TB system for specific relevant dates,
       - Financial records (Venmo, bank accounts, FanDuel/gambling records),
       - Communications that show cohabitation or household structure.
     - Put on record:
       - That such evidence exists (or existed),
       - That Wife has control over it,
       - That you have explicitly asked that it be preserved.

6. Future Possible Motion – Set Aside / Open Prior Order (Praecipe Issue)
   - Concept:
     - Attempt to undo or modify a prior waiver or praecipe if evidence shows you signed without understanding, or under duress/misrepresentation.
   - Realistic assessment:
     - Complex, technical, and higher risk.
     - Typically better attempted with a lawyer after active custody/support issues are stabilized.
     - Priority: low for immediate pro se action; preserve it as a “later with counsel” project.

III. EVIDENCE THEMES & HOW THEY SUPPORT COURT INTERVENTION

1. Not “Just Your Word vs Hers” – Corroboration You Already Have or Can Get

   a) Objective Records
      - Ricky’s criminal record (public records).
      - Venmo and bank statements showing withdrawals.
      - USPS informed delivery / gambling-related mailers.
      - Call logs, message logs
