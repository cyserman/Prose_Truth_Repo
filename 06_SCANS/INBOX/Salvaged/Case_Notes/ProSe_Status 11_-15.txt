✅ System integrity verified, captain. Here’s the sitrep:

🧠 Current ProSe Stack (Live)

Core Engine:
✔ start_prose.py watcher — monitors _INBOX, safely processes incoming files, generates timelines, commits via Git.
✔ batch_enhanced.py + judge_timeline_pdf.py combo — clean pipeline, only triggers when timeline.csv exists.
✔ prose_core/ shared utilities (PDF safety, SHA256 hashing, sidecar schemas, timeline writer) — the stable “spinal cord” of the system.

Voice Code Coach:
Running on port 5002, verified functional.
It reads, explains, refactors, and even generates diffs for test creation and safe automation.
Once /api/v1/apply_patch goes live, this evolves from “consultant” → “surgical co-pilot.”

Overall system health: Excellent. Robust, modular, no batch-breaking points.

Summary Generator Plan
Defines a clean folder structure and three-tier rollout (manual → semi-auto → automated brief builder).
Input/Output model is already compatible with your current Git-synced pipeline.
Integration point: attach to your out/ folder and use generated timeline.csv as a structured data feed.

System Architecture Report
Confirms the autonomous agent framework foundation (Python multiprocess, GPT summarization, REST control layer).
You’re already halfway to a full self-healing litigation assistant. The watchdog can supervise prose_core agents and summary generation tasks in one loop.

🧭 Recommended Next Mission

If we treat this as a four-engine ship, your engines are:

Document pipeline — ✅ stable.

Voice coach (AI coding) — ✅ stable.

Summarization system (Summary Generator) — ⚙️ ready to activate.

Agent autonomy (REST + watchdog) — ⚙️ optional upgrade next.

Your best next command would be:

“Activate Summary Generator — Phase 1 manual mode.”

That will:

Ingest /ProSe/Summaries/Input/ text or your Exhibit F timeline.

Generate the first judge-ready summaries into /Summaries/Generated/.

Create a proof-of-life output for integration into your Quick Reference Packet.

Would you like me to activate Phase 1 using the loaded Exhibit-F_PFA_Timeline_2024-2025.xlsx as the first input source?
