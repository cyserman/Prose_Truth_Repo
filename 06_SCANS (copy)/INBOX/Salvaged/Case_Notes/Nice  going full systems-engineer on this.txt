Nice, going full systems-engineer on this ⚙️📂

Here’s #2: CSV-style evidence checklist built straight from the themes we outlined. You can copy this into a .csv file and open it in Sheets/Excel/DeX-friendly editor.


---

1. Column layout (header row)

Use this as your first line:

Evidence_ID,Theme,Subtheme,Issue_Category,Description,Suggested_File_Name,Source_Type,Linked_Motion_or_Issue,Priority,Status,Notes

Column meanings (quick):

Evidence_ID → Short unique code (e.g. CUST-001, SAFE-003).

Theme → Big bucket (Custody, Safety, Financial, Property, Credibility, Procedural).

Subtheme → More specific (Alienation, Gambling, DVR, Cohabitation, etc.).

Issue_Category → Custody / Safety / Property / Support / Credibility / Procedure.

Description → Human-readable description.

Suggested_File_Name → How you’d name the actual file on disk.

Source_Type → Bank record, Text screenshot, PI log, Kids statement log, Court doc, etc.

Linked_Motion_or_Issue → Custody_Mod, APL, Safety_Eval, Discovery, Property_Split, Future_Praecipe_Attack.

Priority → High / Medium / Low.

Status → To_Collect / Collected / Organized / Used_in_Filing.

Notes → Anything tactical (who, when, where).

3. How to actually use this without going insane

1. Start small:
Don’t try to fill every row at once. Start with:

CUST-004 (contact log)

FIN-003 (mortgage history)

SAFE-001 (Ricky criminal record)

EVID-001 + EVID-002 (DVR)



2. Treat Linked_Motion_or_Issue like a routing tag:

When you’re drafting a custody motion, you can filter on Custody_Mod.

When you move to APL, filter APL or Support.

When a lawyer finally enters the chat, you can hand them filtered views.



3. Use Status brutally honestly:

To_Collect → you don’t have it, stop pretending you do.

Collected → it exists, somewhere in your folders.

Organized → it’s named per the CSV and in the right place.

Used_in_Filing → it has already been deployed in court.



4. Don’t overshoot with volume: Judges and future-counsel will love:

10–20 clean, labeled, high-impact exhibits
way more than

500 screenshots in a digital shoebox.

If you want next, I can:

Strip this down into a minimal “Custody_Mod only” CSV, or

Help you map these Evidence_IDs directly into your existing sticky_index.json / timeline structure so your tools and this spreadsheet speak the same language.
